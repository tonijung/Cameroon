notes for the ArcGIS component
1) download files from Nunn and Puga's webpage
2) convert .txt to binary grid (Arc Toolbox -> Conversion Tools -> To Raster -> ASCII to Raster). Make sure you select Integer as Output Data Type



(1) multiply tri by cellarea at the level of each cell
----Use Raster Calculator: ArcToolBox -> Spatial Analyst Tools -> Math -> Times
----(http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//009z000000z7000000.htm)
(2) calculate the sum for all cells within a region of the value obtained in (1)
----First extract by mask for GIS shapefiles: ArcToolBox -> Spatial Analyst Tools -> Extraction -> Extract by Mask
----(http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/Extract_by_Mask/009z0000002n000000/)
----Then sum by region
(3) calculate the sum for all cells within a region of cellarea
(4) divide the value obtained in (2) by the value obtained in (3) for each region


Note when computing distance..
(1) Take the subnational regional shapefile, use the tool Feature to Point to compute the centroid of each polygon. 
(2) Use the Point Distance tool (http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//00080000001r000000).
