notes for the ArcGIS component
1) download files from Nunn and Puga's webpage
2) convert .txt to binary grid (Arc Toolbox -> Conversion Tools -> To Raster -> ASCII to Raster). Make sure you select Integer as Output Data Type



(1) multiply tri by cellarea at the level of each cell
----Use Raster Calculator: ArcToolBox -> Spatial Analyst Tools -> Math -> Times
----(http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//009z000000z7000000.htm)
(2) calculate the sum for all cells within a region of the value obtained in (1)
----First extract by mask for GIS shapefiles: ArcToolBox -> Spatial Analyst Tools -> Extraction -> Extract by Mask
----(http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/Extract_by_Mask/009z0000002n000000/)
----Then sum by region
(3) calculate the sum for all cells within a region of cellarea
(4) divide the value obtained in (2) by the value obtained in (3) for each region
